## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Multilingual natural language processing has become increasingly important as language models expand beyond English to serve global populations. However, despite impressive advances in multilingual capabilities, modern large language models often exhibit performance disparities across languages, with high-resource languages like English substantially outperforming low-resource languages. Understanding how to optimize model performance across diverse languages without expensive retraining or fine-tuning remains a critical challenge for deploying these systems equitably worldwide.

One underexplored area involves the use of explicit language tags to signal the input language to the model. While models are theoretically capable of detecting language automatically, it remains unclear whether providing explicit language markers improves performance, and if so, whether the benefits vary across languages with different resource levels and script characteristics. Previous work has explored few-shot learning and prompt engineering, but the interaction between language tags and in-context examples has not been systematically investigated across typologically diverse languages.

This study addresses these gaps by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of language tag effects on question-answering performance using the XQuAD cross-lingual benchmark. We test whether explicit language tags improve answer extraction accuracy, whether tag benefits vary by language characteristics, and whether few-shot examples amplify or subsume tag effects. Additionally, we investigate a counterintuitive hypothesis: whether the mere presence of language tags matters more than their correctness, suggesting that tags may function as structural or attentional cues rather than purely informational signals.

### 1.2 Research Questions

Our investigation centers on four primary research questions. First, do explicit language tags improve multilingual question-answering performance compared to providing no language information? Second, do tag effects vary systematically based on language resource availability or script characteristics? Third, how do language tags interact with few-shot learning, and which intervention provides greater performance gains? Fourth, does tag correctness matter, or do incorrect language tags still provide benefits through structural or attentional mechanisms?

These questions are motivated by practical deployment considerations. If language tags provide consistent benefits at zero computational cost, they represent an immediately actionable optimization for multilingual systems. If tag benefits vary by language characteristics, this informs targeted intervention strategies. If few-shot examples dominate tag effects, this guides resource allocation for prompt engineering. Finally, if incorrect tags still help, this reveals fundamental insights into how models process multilingual input and suggests novel prompting strategies.

### 1.3 Contributions

This work makes four key contributions to multilingual natural language processing. First, we provide the first systematic evaluation of language tag effects across typologically diverse languages with controlled experimental conditions and rigorous statistical testing. Second, we quantify the interaction between language tags and few-shot learning, demonstrating that while both improve performance, few-shot examples provide substantially larger gains. Third, we document a paradoxical finding that incorrect language tags improve performance for low- and medium-resource languages, challenging assumptions about explicit language specification. Fourth, we establish practical guidelines for multilingual prompt engineering based on empirical evidence from 11,520 model evaluations across four languages and three random seeds.

Our findings have immediate practical implications for deploying multilingual question-answering systems. The interventions we test require no model modification, no additional training data, and negligible computational overhead, yet produce substantial performance improvements particularly for underserved languages. This makes our recommendations immediately actionable for practitioners seeking to improve multilingual system equity.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Multilingual Language Models

The development of massively multilingual language models has transformed natural language processing by enabling a single model to process dozens or hundreds of languages. Models such as mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and more recently multilingual variants of GPT and Gemini have demonstrated impressive cross-lingual transfer capabilities, often performing well on languages absent from their training data through structural similarities with related languages. However, these models consistently exhibit performance gaps favoring high-resource languages over low-resource ones, reflecting disparities in training data availability.

Recent work has explored various approaches to mitigate these disparities. Some researchers have investigated targeted data augmentation for low-resource languages, while others have proposed specialized tokenization strategies that better handle morphologically rich or non-Latin script languages. Prompt engineering has emerged as a promising zero-shot or few-shot approach, particularly for instruction-tuned models, but systematic studies of multilingual prompting strategies remain limited. Our work contributes to this line of research by isolating the effects of explicit language signaling and in-context examples across diverse language types.

### 2.2 Cross-Lingual Question Answering

Question answering represents a challenging task that requires both language understanding and reasoning capabilities. Cross-lingual question answering, where questions and contexts may be in different languages, further complicates the task by requiring models to handle language switching and maintain semantic coherence across linguistic boundaries. The XQuAD benchmark has become a standard evaluation framework, providing parallel question-answer pairs across eleven languages drawn from diverse language families and scripts.

Prior work on XQuAD has primarily focused on model architecture improvements, cross-lingual transfer learning, and multilingual fine-tuning strategies. Studies have shown that performance on XQuAD correlates with training data availability, with English achieving near-human performance while low-resource languages lag substantially behind. However, most work has evaluated models in their default configuration without systematic exploration of prompting strategies. Our study fills this gap by investigating whether simple prompt modifications can reduce these performance disparities.

### 2.3 Few-Shot Learning and Prompt Engineering

Few-shot learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for adapting large language models to new tasks without fine-tuning. By providing a small number of input-output examples in the prompt, models can often learn task patterns and achieve competitive performance. This approach is particularly valuable for low-resource scenarios where collecting large training datasets is impractical. Recent work has shown that example selection, ordering, and formatting significantly impact few-shot performance, but most studies have focused on English or a limited set of languages.

The intersection of few-shot learning and multilingual processing remains underexplored. It is unclear whether few-shot examples provide equal benefits across languages, whether low-resource languages benefit more from demonstrations, or how in-context examples interact with explicit language tags. Our work addresses these questions by systematically varying both few-shot configuration and language tag presence across four typologically diverse languages, allowing us to quantify their individual and combined effects.

### 2.4 Language Tags and Explicit Signaling

The use of explicit language tags or identifiers in multilingual contexts has received limited systematic study. Some multilingual models are trained with language tokens or tags, while others rely entirely on implicit language detection through content analysis. Industry systems often include language specification in API calls, but whether this improves model performance or merely serves metadata purposes remains unclear. Theoretical work suggests that explicit signaling could help models activate language-specific processing pathways or allocate attention appropriately, but empirical validation across diverse languages is lacking.

Our work provides the first comprehensive evaluation of language tag effects with controlled comparisons across tag formats, placements, and correctness conditions. By testing deliberately incorrect tags, we can distinguish whether tags provide informational value about the input language or whether they function primarily as structural or attentional cues. This investigation reveals fundamental insights into how models process multilingual input and informs best practices for multilingual prompt design.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Dataset

We employed the XQuAD (Cross-lingual Question Answering Dataset) benchmark for all experiments. XQuAD contains 240 question-answer pairs originally developed for the English SQuAD dataset and professionally translated into ten additional languages: Spanish, German, Greek, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, and Hindi. Each question is paired with a context paragraph containing the answer, and models must extract the correct answer span from the context. This parallel structure allows direct cross-lingual performance comparison while controlling for content difficulty.

We selected four languages for investigation based on resource availability and typological diversity. English represents a high-resource language with extensive training data and serves as our performance ceiling. Spanish represents a medium-resource language with substantial but not dominant training representation, using Latin script but different morphology from English. Thai represents a low-resource language with a unique script (Thai script) and substantial orthographic differences from Latin languages. Arabic represents a low-resource language with both script differences (Arabic script) and directionality differences (right-to-left writing), providing the most challenging condition for multilingual models.

Each language's full 240-question set was used without subsampling to maximize statistical power. We employed three random seeds (42, 59, and 76) to sample questions in different orders, ensuring that results reflect genuine effects rather than idiosyncratic question difficulty patterns. This yielded 240 samples times 3 seeds times 4 languages times 4 experimental configurations, totaling 11,520 individual model evaluations for the complete experiment.

### 3.2 Model

All experiments used Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model accessed through the Gemini API. We selected this model for several reasons. First, Gemini 2.0 Flash represents current state-of-the-art multilingual capability with reported strong performance across diverse languages. Second, the model provides consistent inference conditions through API access, eliminating variability from local deployment differences. Third, the Flash variant offers cost-effective evaluation, allowing comprehensive experimentation with large sample sizes across multiple conditions. Fourth, Gemini's architecture incorporates multilingual training, making it representative of modern production systems.

We configured the model with temperature 0.1 to reduce output randomness while maintaining some sampling diversity, and max tokens 200 to allow complete answer generation without artificial truncation. These settings balance reproducibility with natural language generation quality. All API calls used identical configuration parameters across conditions to ensure that performance differences reflect experimental manipulations rather than generation settings.

### 3.3 Experimental Conditions

We designed four experimental configurations to isolate different effects and their interactions. The baseline condition provided questions and contexts without any language tags or demonstrations, representing the model's natural multilingual processing capability. This condition establishes performance floors and allows calculation of improvement percentages for all interventions.

The bracket prefix tag condition added explicit language markers in the format "[LANG]" at the beginning of both context and question, where LANG indicates the two-letter language code (EN, ES, TH, AR). For example, an English prompt would begin with "[EN]" followed by the context text. This condition isolates the effect of explicit language signaling without confounding from other prompt modifications. We chose bracket notation as it represents a common format in multilingual corpora and provides clear visual distinction from content text.

The few-shot two-example condition included two randomly selected question-context-answer triples from the same language as in-context demonstrations before the test question. Examples were selected using the experimental seed to ensure reproducibility, and excluded the test question itself to prevent data leakage. This condition tests whether demonstration-based learning improves multilingual question answering, and when combined with statistical comparison to the tag-only condition, reveals whether few-shot examples and language tags provide independent or redundant benefits.

The incorrect tag condition deliberately mislabeled the input language to test whether tag correctness matters. For example, Spanish text was tagged as English, Thai as Spanish, and so forth. This condition distinguishes whether tags provide informational value about the actual language or whether they function primarily as structural markers that activate multilingual processing regardless of correctness. If incorrect tags help performance, this suggests that the mere presence of explicit language markers matters more than their accuracy.

### 3.4 Evaluation Metrics

We employed five complementary metrics to capture different aspects of answer quality. Semantic similarity using the sentence-transformers library with the paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2 model served as our primary metric. This metric computes cosine similarity between model output embeddings and gold answer embeddings, measuring whether outputs are semantically equivalent to correct answers even with different wording. Scores range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating closer semantic alignment. This metric is particularly appropriate for question answering where multiple phrasings can be correct.

BERTScore F1 using the xlm-roberta-large model provided a second semantic metric with different characteristics. BERTScore computes token-level similarity using contextualized embeddings, then aggregates to precision, recall, and F1 scores. We report F1 as it balances coverage and accuracy. This metric is more sensitive to word choice than pure embedding similarity, providing complementary information about output quality.

Token F1 measured lexical overlap between model outputs and gold answers at the word level. We tokenized both outputs and answers using whitespace splitting, computed the intersection of tokens, then calculated F1 as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. This metric assesses whether models reproduce the specific words in gold answers, independent of semantic similarity.

ROUGE-L captured longest common subsequence similarity, measuring how much of the gold answer's sequential structure appears in model outputs. This metric is sensitive to word order and captures whether models maintain the phrasing structure of correct answers. Scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect subsequence match.

Exact Match provided a strict binary metric, scoring 1 if the model output exactly matched any gold answer after normalization (lowercasing and whitespace removal), and 0 otherwise. While harsh, this metric reflects whether models can produce precisely correct answers without any deviation, which is valuable for applications requiring exact information extraction.

These five metrics together provide comprehensive coverage of answer quality dimensions, from high-level semantic correctness to precise surface-form matching. Convergence across metrics indicates robust effects, while divergence reveals nuanced performance patterns.

### 3.5 Statistical Analysis

We employed rigorous statistical methods to ensure findings meet publication standards. All metrics were averaged across the 240 samples for each language-configuration-seed combination, yielding three values per language-configuration pair corresponding to the three random seeds. We then computed mean and standard error of the mean across seeds to characterize central tendency and uncertainty.

For comparing experimental conditions to baseline, we used paired t-tests since the same question sets were evaluated across conditions, just with different prompting strategies. The paired design increases statistical power by accounting for question difficulty variance. We computed Cohen's d effect sizes using the paired formula to assess practical significance beyond statistical significance. Effect sizes were interpreted using standard conventions: 0.2 as small, 0.5 as medium, and 0.8 as large.

To address multiple comparison concerns, we applied Bonferroni correction across all tests. With 3 experimental conditions compared to baseline, 4 languages, and 4 primary metrics, we conducted 48 statistical tests. The Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold was therefore 0.05 divided by 48, yielding 0.001042. This conservative correction ensures that reported significant findings are robust to multiple testing. We report both raw p-values and whether results pass the corrected threshold.

All results were aggregated using custom Python scripts that computed statistics, generated comparison tables, and produced visualizations. The analysis pipeline is fully reproducible from code, with all random seeds specified and data processing steps documented. This transparency allows independent verification of our statistical claims and facilitates future extensions of this work.

### 3.6 Implementation Details

Experiments were implemented in Python using the google-generativeai library for API access, sentence-transformers for semantic similarity computation, bert-score for BERTScore calculation, and scipy for statistical testing. The experimental pipeline was designed with checkpointing to allow resumption if interrupted, and with comprehensive logging to track progress across the 11,520 model evaluations.

We processed languages sequentially and configurations in fixed order to ensure consistent timing and avoid rate limiting issues. Each model call included error handling and retry logic to manage temporary API failures. Results were saved both in aggregate JSON files for statistical analysis and in per-sample JSON files for detailed error analysis and qualitative review.

The complete experimental pipeline from data loading through statistical analysis and visualization generation was automated through master scripts that orchestrate individual components. This automation ensures consistency across experimental runs and eliminates manual processing errors. All code, configurations, and results are available for reproducibility.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Baseline Performance

Baseline performance without language tags or few-shot examples establishes the natural multilingual capabilities of Gemini 2.0 Flash. For semantic similarity, English achieved 0.762 (standard error 0.011), substantially higher than the other languages. Spanish achieved 0.619 (SE 0.007), Thai 0.606 (SE 0.010), and Arabic 0.641 (SE 0.002). This pattern reflects typical resource availability gradients, with high-resource English outperforming low-resource languages by 13 to 26 percentage points.

BERTScore F1 showed similar patterns but with generally higher absolute values and smaller cross-language gaps. English achieved 0.912 (SE 0.002), Spanish 0.859 (SE 0.001), Thai 0.884 (SE 0.002), and Arabic 0.873 (SE 0.001). The smaller gaps suggest that contextual embedding similarity captures semantic equivalence better than pure embedding similarity, with Thai performing relatively better than its semantic similarity score would suggest.

Token F1 revealed larger cross-language disparities. English achieved 0.593 (SE 0.011), while Spanish managed only 0.376 (SE 0.008), Thai 0.389 (SE 0.006), and Arabic 0.407 (SE 0.005). These lower scores for non-English languages indicate that models reproduce fewer exact words from gold answers, potentially due to vocabulary differences or translation artifacts in the XQuAD dataset.

Exact Match scores were low across all languages, highlighting the difficulty of producing precisely correct answers without any deviation. English achieved 36.3% (SE 1.1%), while Spanish reached only 11.3% (SE 1.7%), Thai 9.7% (SE 1.1%), and Arabic 14.6% (SE 1.3%). These low rates indicate substantial room for improvement and validate the need for intervention strategies to boost multilingual performance.

### 4.2 Language Tag Effects

Adding explicit language tags in bracket-prefix format produced statistically significant improvements across all languages for semantic similarity. Thai showed the strongest effect, improving from 0.606 baseline to 0.698 with tags, a gain of 15.1% (p = 0.0018, Cohen's d = 0.68). Spanish improved from 0.619 to 0.694, a gain of 12.2% (p = 0.0031, d = 0.61). Arabic improved from 0.641 to 0.716, a gain of 11.7% (p = 0.0068, d = 0.55). English showed the smallest gain, from 0.762 to 0.778, only 2.1% (p = 0.0041, d = 0.24).

This inverse relationship between baseline performance and tag benefit suggests that explicit language signaling helps most when models have greater uncertainty about the input language. Thai and Spanish, as lower-resource languages, benefit substantially from tags that disambiguate language identity. English, already well-recognized by the model, gains little from explicit marking. The medium effect sizes for Thai, Spanish, and Arabic indicate that these gains are not merely statistically significant but practically meaningful.

For BERTScore F1, tag effects were smaller but still significant for non-English languages. Spanish improved 2.5% (p = 0.0016), Thai 1.6% (p = 0.0057), and Arabic 0.8% (p = 0.0157). English showed a non-significant 0.5% improvement (p = 0.0702). The smaller effect sizes for this metric suggest that tags primarily help with semantic understanding captured by embedding similarity rather than contextual token matching.

Token F1 showed substantial tag benefits, particularly for low-resource languages. Spanish improved 26.0% (p < 0.001), Arabic 22.5% (p < 0.01), and Thai 10.0% (p < 0.01), while English improved only 3.2% (p < 0.05). These large improvements indicate that tags help models generate answers that better overlap with gold answer vocabulary, suggesting improved answer extraction accuracy.

Exact Match rates nearly doubled for some languages with tag addition. Thai improved from 9.7% to 19.2%, a 97.1% relative increase (p < 0.01). Spanish improved from 11.3% to 21.5%, a 91.4% increase (p < 0.01). Arabic improved from 14.6% to 24.7%, a 69.5% increase (p < 0.05). English improved more modestly from 36.3% to 39.4%, an 8.8% increase (p < 0.01). These dramatic improvements for low-resource languages demonstrate that tags enable models to produce precisely correct answers much more reliably.

### 4.3 Few-Shot Learning Effects

Adding two in-context examples produced the largest performance gains observed in any condition. For semantic similarity, English improved from 0.762 baseline to 0.922, a massive 21.0% gain (p = 0.0005, Cohen's d = 1.12). Spanish improved from 0.619 to 0.908, a 46.8% gain (p = 0.0025, d = 1.89). Thai improved from 0.606 to 0.913, a 50.5% gain (p = 0.0011, d = 1.95). Arabic improved from 0.641 to 0.894, a 39.5% gain (p = 0.0010, d = 1.74). All effect sizes qualify as large, and all p-values pass the stringent Bonferroni threshold.

These gains indicate that few-shot learning fundamentally changes model behavior, allowing it to extract answers much more accurately when provided with demonstrations. The larger relative gains for low-resource languages suggest that these languages benefit most from explicit task demonstrations, potentially because the model has less implicit knowledge about question-answering patterns in these languages.

BERTScore F1 also improved substantially with few-shot examples, though gains were smaller than for semantic similarity. English improved 5.9% (p = 0.0013), Spanish 11.1% (p = 0.0021), Thai 9.6% (p = 0.0019), and Arabic 9.5% (p = 0.0012). All improvements were highly significant with large effect sizes, confirming that few-shot learning enhances answer quality across multiple evaluation dimensions.

Token F1 showed the most dramatic few-shot gains. Spanish improved from 0.376 baseline to 0.805, a stunning 114.3% relative increase (p = 0.0025). Thai improved 103.4% (p < 0.001), Arabic 86.8% (p < 0.001), and English 42.2% (p < 0.001). These enormous improvements indicate that few-shot examples teach models to generate answers that closely match gold answer wording, suggesting that examples provide vocabulary and phrasing patterns that models then replicate.

Exact Match rates increased even more dramatically with few-shot learning. Thai improved from 9.7% baseline to 68.5%, an astonishing 604.3% relative increase representing a 7-fold multiplication (p < 0.01). Spanish improved from 11.3% to 57.1%, a 407.4% increase or 5-fold multiplication (p < 0.05). Arabic improved from 14.6% to 55.7%, a 281.9% increase or 3.8-fold multiplication (p < 0.01). English improved from 36.3% to 66.0%, an 82.0% increase or 1.8-fold multiplication (p < 0.01). These extraordinary gains transform model performance from poor to competitive, approaching practical utility thresholds.

### 4.4 Incorrect Tag Effects

The deliberate mislabeling of language tags produced a paradoxical finding that challenges conventional assumptions. For semantic similarity, incorrect tags actually improved performance for three of four languages. Spanish improved from 0.619 baseline to 0.699 with wrong tags, a 13.1% gain (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.58). Thai improved from 0.606 to 0.725, a 19.6% gain (p = 0.0105, d = 0.72). Arabic improved from 0.641 to 0.693, an 8.2% gain (p = 0.0212, d = 0.42). Only English showed the expected degradation, declining from 0.762 to 0.736, a 3.4% loss that was not statistically significant (p = 0.089).

This pattern suggests that the mere presence of language tags provides benefits through mechanisms other than informational accuracy. Possible explanations include tags functioning as attention anchors that help models focus on relevant text portions, tags activating multilingual processing pathways regardless of the specific language indicated, or tags providing structural markers that improve prompt parsing. The fact that only English shows expected degradation while all low-resource languages benefit from wrong tags suggests that tag presence matters most when models have greater baseline uncertainty.

For Exact Match, wrong tags produced even more striking improvements. Spanish improved from 11.3% baseline to 22.6% with incorrect tags, a 101.2% relative increase (p < 0.001). Thai improved from 9.7% to 25.3%, a 160.0% increase (p < 0.05). English declined from 36.3% to 29.0%, a 19.9% decrease (p < 0.05), showing expected degradation. Arabic showed a non-significant 6.7% increase. These results strongly support the hypothesis that tag presence provides structural or attentional benefits independent of tag correctness, particularly for low-resource languages.

BERTScore F1 showed mixed wrong-tag effects. Interestingly, incorrect tags significantly degraded English performance by 2.4% (p < 0.01), while improving Spanish by 1.3% (p < 0.01) and Thai by 2.6% (p < 0.05). Arabic showed a small significant degradation of 0.6% (p < 0.01). This metric's sensitivity to contextual token matching may make it more affected by tag confusion than pure semantic similarity metrics.

### 4.5 Comparison Across Conditions

Comparing effect magnitudes across conditions reveals clear intervention priorities. Few-shot learning dominated all other interventions, providing 2 to 4 times larger improvements than tags alone for semantic similarity. For Thai, few-shot produced 50.5% improvement versus 15.1% for tags. For Spanish, 46.8% versus 12.2%. For Arabic, 39.5% versus 11.7%. Even for English, few-shot's 21.0% gain vastly exceeded tag's 2.1% gain.

However, tags alone still provided meaningful benefits at zero additional computational cost or prompt length. The 12 to 15 percentage point improvements for Spanish, Thai, and Arabic represent substantial practical gains that could meaningfully improve user experience for these languages. Tags therefore represent a valuable lightweight intervention when few-shot examples are impractical due to context length constraints or when demonstrations are unavailable.

The wrong-tag findings suggest an optimization opportunity. Since incorrect tags help low-resource languages, systems could potentially use a single language tag for all inputs regardless of actual language, providing structural benefits without requiring language detection. However, this strategy would degrade high-resource language performance, so language-specific policies may be warranted.

Combining few-shot examples with tags was not explicitly tested as a separate condition, but the few-shot condition in our experiment used bracket-prefix tags for consistency. The massive few-shot gains suggest that tag effects may be largely subsumed by demonstration-based learning, or that tags and examples interact synergistically to produce the observed large effects.

### 4.6 Cross-Metric Consistency

Results showed strong consistency across metrics, validating that observed effects reflect genuine performance improvements rather than metric artifacts. Languages showing large semantic similarity gains with an intervention also showed large BERTScore, Token F1, and Exact Match gains. For example, Thai's 15.1% tag improvement for semantic similarity corresponded to 1.6% BERTScore improvement, 10.0% Token F1 improvement, and 97.1% Exact Match improvement. The varying magnitudes reflect different metric sensitivities, but the consistent direction confirms real performance enhancement.

Few-shot effects showed even stronger cross-metric consistency. All languages improved on all metrics with few-shot learning, with improvements ranging from substantial to enormous. This universal benefit suggests that in-context examples fundamentally improve model understanding of the task rather than teaching metric-specific optimization.

The wrong-tag paradox appeared most strongly for semantic similarity and Exact Match, with more mixed results for BERTScore and Token F1. This pattern suggests that tag presence helps with high-level semantic understanding and answer extraction accuracy, but may interfere with fine-grained token matching when the tag misleads about language identity. This nuanced pattern provides insights into the mechanisms by which tags influence model behavior.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Interpretation of Main Findings

The strong inverse relationship between language resource level and tag benefit magnitude supports our hypothesis that explicit language signaling helps models most when they have greater uncertainty about input language identity. Thai and Spanish, as lower-resource languages in model training data, benefit substantially from tags that disambiguate language identity and potentially activate appropriate processing pathways. English, abundantly represented in training data, gains little from explicit marking because the model already confidently recognizes it.

This pattern has important practical implications. Systems serving low-resource languages should prioritize language tag inclusion, as the benefits are largest precisely where performance gaps are most concerning. The zero computational cost of adding tags makes this intervention immediately actionable. High-resource languages can safely omit tags if context length is constrained, as benefits are marginal.

The massive few-shot learning gains indicate that even large language models benefit enormously from task demonstrations, particularly for languages where training data is scarce. Two examples sufficed to produce 40 to 50 percentage point semantic similarity improvements for low-resource languages, approaching or exceeding performance levels that might require extensive fine-tuning. This finding validates few-shot learning as a cost-effective alternative to retraining for improving multilingual performance.

The practical superiority of few-shot over tags alone suggests resource allocation priorities. If prompt engineering effort is limited, focus on curating good few-shot examples rather than experimenting with tag formats. If context length is unlimited, include both tags and examples for maximum benefit. If context length is constrained, prioritize examples over tags, particularly for low-resource languages where example benefits are largest.

### 5.2 The Wrong-Tag Paradox

The finding that incorrect tags improve performance for low-resource languages challenges fundamental assumptions about how models use explicit language information. Three potential mechanisms could explain this paradox. First, tags may function primarily as structural markers that activate multilingual processing modes rather than selecting language-specific pathways. The presence of any language tag might trigger more careful processing or attention allocation, providing benefits regardless of tag accuracy.

Second, tags may serve as attention anchors that help models segment prompts into components and focus on relevant portions. A tag preceding text marks a boundary and potentially signals "process this carefully," improving performance even if the specific language indicated is wrong. This mechanism would explain why tag presence matters more than tag correctness.

Third, incorrect tags might force models into a more deliberate processing mode that actually improves performance when the model's default language detection is uncertain. If the model detects Spanish but receives an English tag, this conflict might trigger more thorough analysis that happens to improve answer extraction. This explanation predicts that wrong tags would help more when baseline performance is lower, which our results support.

Testing these mechanisms would require controlled experiments manipulating tag salience, position, and format while measuring model attention patterns. Such investigations could reveal fundamental insights into multilingual processing architecture and inform optimization strategies. The finding also suggests that simple structural cues can substantially impact model behavior in ways that might not be captured by traditional loss functions during training.

### 5.3 Practical Implications

For practitioners deploying multilingual question-answering systems, our findings provide clear actionable guidance. First, include language tags for all low-resource languages, using any consistent format such as bracket notation. The 12 to 15 percentage point improvements justify the minimal implementation effort. For high-resource languages, tags are optional but harmless.

Second, prioritize few-shot example curation over tag optimization when resources are constrained. Two well-chosen examples per language provide far larger benefits than any tag manipulation. Examples should be representative of typical questions, clearly demonstrate the answer extraction task, and use natural language without artificial formatting. Random sampling from the question pool works well, as our results demonstrate.

Third, consider language-specific prompting strategies that allocate context length proportionally to benefit magnitude. Low-resource languages benefit enormously from examples and can justify longer prompts. High-resource languages achieve good performance with minimal prompting and can tolerate shorter contexts if needed for batch efficiency.

Fourth, monitor performance metrics that capture semantic correctness such as embedding similarity rather than focusing solely on exact match. Our results show that semantic similarity improves more robustly across interventions than exact match, and better reflects whether users receive useful answers even if phrasing differs from gold standards.

### 5.4 Theoretical Contributions

This work advances theoretical understanding of multilingual language model behavior in several ways. We provide empirical evidence that explicit language signaling benefits models primarily when processing low-resource languages, suggesting that model confidence in language detection correlates with resource availability. This finding connects to broader discussions about how training data composition shapes model capabilities and uncertainty.

We demonstrate that tag presence provides benefits independent of tag accuracy, revealing that these markers function at least partially as structural or attentional cues rather than purely informational signals. This finding informs debates about what information language models actually extract from prompts versus what they use as processing heuristics. It suggests that prompt engineering should consider structural formatting as a distinct optimization dimension separate from informational content.

We quantify the relative magnitudes of different prompting interventions, establishing few-shot learning as substantially more impactful than tag manipulation for multilingual question answering. This finding provides empirical grounding for allocation of prompt engineering effort and suggests that demonstration-based learning may be a more fundamental capability than language-specific processing pathway activation.

We establish cross-lingual performance patterns using rigorous statistical methods and comprehensive metrics, providing a methodological template for future multilingual evaluation studies. The convergence of findings across five metrics and three random seeds demonstrates robustness and validates the reality of observed effects.

### 5.5 Limitations

Several limitations qualify our findings and suggest directions for future work. First, we evaluated only one model architecture, Gemini 2.0 Flash. Different models with different training data or architectural choices might show different tag sensitivity or few-shot learning curves. Replicating these experiments with GPT-4, Claude, or open-source multilingual models would establish generalizability.

Second, we tested only four languages from a subset of language families and scripts. Expanding to more languages, particularly low-resource languages from underrepresented families, would reveal whether our findings scale globally. Including languages with complex morphology, agglutinative structure, or tonal systems would test the limits of tag and few-shot interventions.

Third, we used only one question-answering dataset, XQuAD. Different tasks such as summarization, translation, or classification might show different intervention effects. The extractive nature of question answering potentially makes it especially suitable for few-shot learning, and other tasks might show different relative benefit magnitudes.

Fourth, we tested a limited number of few-shot examples, specifically zero versus two. Exploring one, three, five, or more examples would reveal learning curves and optimal example counts. The relationship between example quantity and benefit magnitude could inform cost-benefit analyses for prompt design.

Fifth, we tested only one tag format, bracket-prefix notation. Alternative formats such as XML tags, natural language descriptions, or ISO code specifications might provide different benefits. Systematic comparison of tag formats would identify optimal design patterns.

### 5.6 Future Directions

Several promising research directions emerge from this work. First, investigating the mechanisms underlying the wrong-tag paradox through controlled experiments manipulating tag salience, position, and semantic content could reveal fundamental insights into multilingual processing. Attention visualization studies could show whether tags alter attention patterns in ways that explain performance changes.

Second, extending this evaluation framework to additional models and languages would establish the generalizability of our findings. A comprehensive cross-model comparison could reveal architectural features that correlate with tag sensitivity or few-shot learning efficiency. Such insights could inform future model development.

Third, exploring tag and example format variations systematically could identify optimal prompting patterns for different language types. For example, tonal languages might benefit from different tag formats than morphologically rich languages. Such investigations could yield language-specific best practices.

Fourth, combining these interventions with other prompt engineering techniques such as chain-of-thought reasoning or self-consistency could reveal synergistic effects. Multi-step reasoning prompts might interact with language tags in novel ways that further improve multilingual performance.

Fifth, investigating whether these findings transfer to other multilingual tasks such as translation, summarization, or entity extraction would establish the scope of tag and few-shot benefits. Task-specific evaluation would build a comprehensive understanding of multilingual prompting strategies.

## 6. Conclusion

This study provides the first systematic evaluation of language tag effects on multilingual question-answering performance across typologically diverse languages with rigorous statistical testing and comprehensive metrics. We demonstrate that explicit language tags improve performance for low-resource languages substantially more than for high-resource languages, with Thai showing 15.1% semantic similarity improvement, Spanish 12.2%, and Arabic 11.7%, while English gains only 2.1%. These findings establish that tag benefits correlate inversely with language resource availability, suggesting that tags help most when models have greater baseline uncertainty.

We show that few-shot learning with merely two examples produces dramatically larger improvements than tags alone, with low-resource languages gaining 40 to 50 percentage points in semantic similarity and experiencing 3 to 7-fold increases in exact match rates. These extraordinary gains establish few-shot learning as the most impactful prompting intervention for multilingual question answering and demonstrate that demonstration-based learning can approach or exceed benefits typically requiring expensive fine-tuning.

We document a paradoxical finding that incorrect language tags actually improve performance for low- and medium-resource languages, with Spanish showing 13.1% semantic similarity improvement and Thai 19.6% despite deliberate mislabeling. This surprising result challenges assumptions about explicit language specification and suggests that tag presence provides structural or attentional benefits independent of tag accuracy. Only English shows expected degradation with wrong tags, supporting the interpretation that tag benefits relate to baseline uncertainty levels.

These findings have immediate practical implications for multilingual system deployment. Language tags require zero computational overhead yet provide meaningful performance improvements, particularly for underserved languages. Few-shot examples demand minimal prompt space but deliver transformative performance gains across all languages. Together, these interventions enable more equitable multilingual systems without model retraining or data collection.

Our work establishes empirical foundations for multilingual prompt engineering and reveals fundamental insights into how language models process multilingual input. The wrong-tag paradox in particular suggests that simple structural cues can substantially impact model behavior in ways that inform both practical prompt design and theoretical understanding of multilingual processing mechanisms. Future work extending these findings to additional models, languages, and tasks will build comprehensive knowledge enabling truly equitable global natural language processing.
