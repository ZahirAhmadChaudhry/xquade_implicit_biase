# Experiment Run Log

Legacy console transcript removed on 2025-10-25 after the evaluation pipeline refactor introduced embedding-based metrics and paired statistical tests.

- **Next step**: reinstall dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` if the environment predates the refactor.
- Run `python experiment.py` to regenerate outputs with semantic similarity, overlap, and statistical summaries.
- Paste the fresh console transcript below this note so the run history stays in sync with the new methodology.
