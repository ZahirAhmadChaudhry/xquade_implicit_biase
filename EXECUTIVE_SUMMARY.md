# Executive Summary: Research Gaps Analysis

**Project**: Multilingual LLM Bias Evaluation using XQuAD  
**Assessment Date**: October 25, 2025  
**Current Status**: ⚠️ **NOT PUBLICATION-READY** (Estimated 30% complete)  
**Time to Publication**: 6-8 weeks of additional work

---

## 🎯 QUICK VERDICT

Your project demonstrates a **solid research idea** with **promising preliminary results**, but it requires significant additional work before it can be published in a peer-reviewed venue. Think of this as a successful **pilot study** that needs to be expanded into a full experiment.

## 🚨 TOP 3 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. **Invalid KL Divergence** 🔴 **BLOCKING ISSUE**
- **Problem**: Code uses random simulated logits instead of real ones
- **Impact**: All KL divergence results are meaningless and cannot be reported
- **Fix**: Switch to open-source model OR use embedding-based distances OR remove metric
- **Time**: 1 week

### 2. **Insufficient Sample Size** 🔴 **BLOCKING ISSUE**
- **Problem**: Only 15 samples per language (60 total) - too small for statistical validity
- **Minimum**: 50 samples per language
- **Preferred**: 100+ samples or full test set (240)
- **Fix**: Change sample_size parameter and re-run
- **Time**: 1-2 days

### 3. **No Statistical Significance Testing** 🔴 **BLOCKING ISSUE**
- **Problem**: No p-values, confidence intervals, or effect sizes reported
- **Fix**: Add scipy statistical tests, calculate significance and effect sizes
- **Time**: 2-3 days

## 📊 WHAT'S MISSING: THE BIG PICTURE

| Component | Current | Needed | Gap |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----|
| **Sample Size** | 15/lang | 100+/lang | ❌ 85% short |
| **Languages** | 4 | 8-11 | ❌ 50% short |
| **Statistical Tests** | 0 | Full suite | ❌ Missing |
| **Baselines** | Historical | Direct runs | ❌ Missing |
| **Metrics** | 2-3 | 6-8 | ❌ 60% short |
| **Ablations** | 0 | 3-5 studies | ❌ Missing |
| **Error Analysis** | None | Systematic | ❌ Missing |
| **Human Eval** | None | 50-100 samples | ❌ Missing |
| **Visualizations** | None | 6-8 figures | ❌ Missing |

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM ANALYSIS

### What You're Doing Right ✅
- Clear, testable hypothesis
- Appropriate dataset (XQuAD)
- Well-structured code
- Good documentation
- Promising initial results

### What Needs Immediate Attention ⚠️
- **Data validity**: Simulated logits make results unreliable
- **Statistical power**: Sample too small for conclusions
- **Rigor**: No significance testing or error analysis
- **Scope**: Too narrow (4 languages, 1 model, 1 metric type)
- **Depth**: Surface-level analysis, no ablations or baselines
