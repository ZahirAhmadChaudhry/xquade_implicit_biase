# Research Gaps Analysis: Multilingual LLM Bias Evaluation Project

**Date**: October 25, 2025  
**Project**: Implicit Translation Bias in LLMs using XQuAD Benchmarking  
**Purpose**: Pre-publication assessment for research article preparation

---

## Executive Summary

This project investigates implicit translation bias in Large Language Models using explicit language tags. While the experimental framework is solid, **several critical gaps exist that must be addressed before publication**. The current experiment shows promising initial results but lacks the rigor, depth, and completeness expected for a peer-reviewed research article.

---

## 1. CRITICAL GAPS - Must Address Before Publication

### 1.1 Statistical Rigor and Significance Testing ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Current State:**
- Sample size: Only 15 samples per language (60 total)
- No statistical significance testing
- No confidence intervals
- No power analysis
- Standard deviations reported but no statistical tests

**What's Missing:**
- **Hypothesis Testing**: No t-tests, ANOVA, or Mann-Whitney U tests to validate that observed differences are statistically significant
- **Effect Size Calculations**: Need Cohen's d or similar metrics to quantify the magnitude of differences
- **Multiple Comparison Corrections**: Testing 4 languages requires Bonferroni or FDR correction
- **Bootstrapping/Resampling**: For robust confidence interval estimation with small samples
- **Power Analysis**: Demonstrate that sample size is adequate to detect meaningful effects
- **Reproducibility Metrics**: Inter-run reliability (test multiple runs with same prompts)

**Recommended Actions:**
```python
# Add statistical testing module:
- scipy.stats for t-tests, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U
- statsmodels for regression analysis
- scikit-posthocs for post-hoc tests
- Calculate p-values, effect sizes, and confidence intervals
- Increase sample size to at least 50-100 per language
```

### 1.2 Baseline and Ablation Studies ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Current State:**
- Only compares tagged vs. raw prompts
- Compares against historical XQuAD baselines (mBERT, XLM-R) but doesn't run them directly
- No ablation studies on tagging variations

**What's Missing:**
1. **Direct Baseline Comparisons**:
   - Run actual mBERT/XLM-R models on same test set
   - Test other modern LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3, etc.)
   - Compare against translation-based approaches

2. **Ablation Studies on Language Tags**:
   - Different tag formats: `[lang=es]`, `Language: Spanish`, `{es}`, etc.
   - Tag placement: beginning, end, both, inline
   - Tag verbosity: ISO codes vs. full language names
   - Multiple tags vs. single tag

3. **Control Conditions**:
   - Unrelated tags (e.g., `[task=qa]` instead of language)
   - Random/incorrect language tags
   - Multilingual prompts without explicit tags

4. **Few-shot vs. Zero-shot**:
   - Current approach is zero-shot only
   - Test with 1-shot, 3-shot, 5-shot examples

### 1.3 Simulated Logits Problem ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE**

**Current State:**
```python
# Code uses SIMULATED logits, not real ones
simulated_logits = np.random.rand(num_simulated_tokens, SIMULATED_VOCAB_SIZE)
```

**What's Missing:**
- **Real logit access**: Gemini API doesn't provide token-level logits
- **KL Divergence validity**: KL divergence calculated on random simulated data is **meaningless for research claims**
- This fundamentally undermines the "semantic drift" measurement

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Option A - Use Open Source Models**:
   - Switch to HuggingFace models (mBERT, XLM-R, Llama) with direct logit access
   - Use models where you can extract true probability distributions

2. **Option B - Alternative Metrics**:
   - Replace KL divergence with embedding-based distance metrics
   - Use cosine similarity between embeddings
   - Jensen-Shannon divergence on embeddings
   - Semantic textual similarity (STS) scores

3. **Option C - Acknowledge Limitation**:
   - Remove KL divergence entirely
   - Focus only on BERTScore metrics
   - Clearly state in methodology that logit access is unavailable

**Current Impact**: The KL divergence results in your paper **cannot be trusted** and should not be reported without fixing this issue.

### 1.4 Evaluation Metrics Depth ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Current State:**
- BERTScore F1 (semantic similarity)
- KL Divergence (currently invalid)
- Comparison to baseline F1 scores

**What's Missing:**
1. **Standard QA Metrics**:
   - **Exact Match (EM)**: Does answer exactly match reference?
   - **F1 Score (token-level)**: Standard SQuAD metric
   - **Character-level F1**: For morphologically rich languages
   - **ROUGE scores**: For longer answer overlap

2. **Cross-lingual Specific Metrics**:
   - **Translation Quality**: BLEU, COMET, or chrF if translation is involved
   - **Cross-lingual Semantic Similarity**: Measure alignment across languages
   - **Language Detection Accuracy**: Does model maintain target language?

3. **Consistency Metrics**:
   - **Self-BLEU**: Measure diversity/consistency across multiple runs
   - **Variance across runs**: Test same prompt multiple times
   - **Cross-language consistency**: Compare EN→ES vs ES→EN patterns

4. **Error Analysis Metrics**:
   - **Error categorization**: Semantic errors vs. syntactic vs. factual
   - **Failure mode analysis**: When does tagging help vs. hurt?

### 1.5 Larger and More Diverse Sample Size ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Current State:**
- 15 samples per language (60 total)
- Only 4 languages tested
- Only SQuAD-derived questions (single domain)

**What's Missing:**
1. **Sample Size**:
   - 15 samples is insufficient for publication
   - Minimum 50-100 samples per language
   - Ideally use full XQuAD test set (240 samples × 11 languages)

2. **Language Coverage**:
   - Currently: EN, ES, TH, AR
   - Missing from XQuAD: DE, EL, RU, TR, VI, ZH, HI, RO
   - Should test at least 8-10 languages
   - Include more language families (Slavic, Sino-Tibetan, etc.)

3. **Domain Diversity**:
   - XQuAD is only Wikipedia-based QA
   - Test on other domains: scientific, legal, conversational
   - Use multiple QA datasets: TyDi QA, MLQA, etc.

## 2. MAJOR GAPS - Strongly Recommended

### 2.1 Qualitative Analysis and Error Analysis

**What's Missing:**
- **Manual error inspection**: Examine 20-30 examples per language in detail
- **Error taxonomy**: Create categories for different failure modes
- **Case studies**: Deep dive into interesting examples
- **Linguistic analysis**: Why does tagging help more for some languages?
- **Visualization**: Show example comparisons side-by-side

**Recommended Addition:**
```markdown
## Qualitative Analysis Section:
- Present 5-10 example outputs (raw vs. tagged)
- Categorize errors: semantic drift, hallucination, format issues
- Analyze language-specific phenomena
- Expert linguistic annotation (if possible)
```

### 2.2 Language Resource Level Analysis

**Current State:**
- Categorizes languages as "top" (EN, ES) vs "underrepresented" (TH, AR)
- Simple mean comparison

**What's Missing:**
- **Quantitative resource metrics**: Training data size, Wikipedia articles, etc.
- **Fine-grained resource categories**: High/Medium/Low/Very Low
- **Script/writing system analysis**: Latin vs. Arabic vs. Thai scripts
- **Linguistic typology**: Correlation with morphological complexity, word order, etc.
- **Pre-training data analysis**: How much of each language in Gemini's training?

### 2.3 Prompt Engineering Analysis

**Current State:**
- Single prompt format: "Context: X\nQuestion: Y\nAnswer:"
- Single tag format: `[lang=es]`

**What's Missing:**
1. **Prompt Variations**:
   - Different instructional formats
   - Chain-of-thought prompting
   - Explicit language instructions (e.g., "Answer in Spanish")
   - Contextual priming

2. **Systematic Prompt Study**:
   - Test 3-5 different prompt templates
   - Compare tag-based vs. instruction-based language specification
   - Investigate interaction effects

### 2.4 Robustness and Reproducibility

**What's Missing:**
1. **Multiple Runs**:
   - Run each experiment 3-5 times with different random seeds
   - Report mean and variance across runs
   - Check for API variability (temperature=0.1 still has some randomness)

2. **Model Versions**:
   - Document exact model version/checkpoint
   - Test if results hold across model updates
   - Consider testing multiple Gemini versions

3. **Reproducibility Package**:
   - Complete code with documentation
   - Exact data splits and preprocessing
   - Random seeds and configuration files
   - Docker container or environment specification

  - Language embeddings
  - Multilingual prompting strategies
  - Adapter-based approaches
  - Translation-based methods

**Recommended Additions:**
- Comprehensive related work section (15-20 papers minimum)

- **Limitations in practice**: When does tagging fail?

**Recommended Addition:**
```markdown
## Practical Applications Section:

```

### 3.3 Computational Efficiency Analysis

**What's Missing:**
- **Latency measurements**: Does tagging affect inference time?
- **Cost analysis**: Token usage, API costs
- **Scalability**: Performance with very long contexts
- **Efficiency comparisons**: Tagged prompts vs. fine-tuned models

### 3.4 Human Evaluation

**What's Missing:**
- **Human judgments**: Do humans perceive the differences?
- **Preference studies**: Do native speakers prefer tagged outputs?
- **Quality ratings**: Fluency, adequacy, relevance scores
- **Cross-cultural validation**: Cultural appropriateness of answers

**Recommended Scale:**
- At least 50-100 examples rated by 3+ native speakers per language
- Use established evaluation frameworks (e.g., HTER, MQM)

---

## 4. METHODOLOGICAL CONCERNS

### 4.1 Confounding Variables

**Current Issues:**
- Different BERTScore models might favor certain languages
- XLM-RoBERTa baseline may not be ideal for all languages
- Context length varies by language (as shown in XQuAD stats)

**Recommendations:**
- Control for answer length
- Normalize by language-specific baselines
- Test multiple evaluation models

### 4.2 Cherry-picking Risk

**Current Issues:**
- Small sample size (15) makes results sensitive to outliers
- No pre-registration of hypotheses
- Multiple metrics without correction could lead to p-hacking

**Recommendations:**
- Pre-register analysis plan (even retroactively, document it)
- Use Bonferroni or FDR correction for multiple comparisons
- Report all metrics, not just favorable ones
